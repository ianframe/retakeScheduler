# retakeScheduler
An online web app for AP CS students to reschedule their quiz retakes, view resources for a standard, and see their growth in learning.


Alpha Version:
+ Project currently supports roles functionality with an admin and student role. 
+ Standard descriptions are dynamically generated after selecting the unit. 
+ Allows for two teachers to utilize the app. 
+ Retakes begin at a requested state and after admin approval transition to an approved state.

Improvements Needed:
+ Credits system to request a retake. 
+ Email system -- configure env variable and handle routing. 
+ Sample quizzes with keys for each standard.
